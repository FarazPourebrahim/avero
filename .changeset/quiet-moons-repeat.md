Publish the type declarations through a top-level `types` field as well as the `exports` map. TypeScript only reads `exports` under `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, `"node16"` or `"nodenext"`; a project still on the legacy `"node"` setting — which is also what an editor assumes for a file with no tsconfig — ignored it, found no `main` or `types` to fall back to, and typed every import as `any`, so no props were suggested and no mistake was reported. Those projects now get the component prop types.

`moduleResolution: "bundler"` is still the setting to be on: under the legacy one, prop types that come from `class-variance-authority` (`variant`, `tone`, `size`, `radius`) stay `any`, because that package reaches its own types only through its `exports` map.
